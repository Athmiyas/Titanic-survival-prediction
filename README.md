## Overview

This repository focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning techniques. The approach includes thorough exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing to handle missing data and feature engineering, and evaluating several classification models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and Logistic Regression. The final model, Random Forest, achieved an accuracy of approximately **82.68%**.

## Features

- In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns  
- Data cleaning and missing value imputation  
- Feature selection and engineering to improve model performance  
- Model training and evaluation using different classifiers  
- Prediction generation for unseen test data
